Equations Used
	Thermal Energy Produced 
	from Kinetic Energy Dissipated: Ff = (mv^2)/2d
		-Ff = frictional force
		-d = distance braked
	
	Temperature Change from Thermal Energy Produced
	Ff * d = mcT
	
	T = (Ff * d) / mc 
	
	Weight on Front Axle: Wf = (c/L)*W - (h/L)*M*a 
    Weight on Rear Axle: Wr = (b/L)*W + (h/L)*M*a
	
	
	
	F = u * Tengine * xg * xd * n / Rw
